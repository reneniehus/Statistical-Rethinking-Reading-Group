# 3M1. Suppose the globe tossing data had turned out to be 8 water in 15 tosses. Construct the posterior distribution, using grid approximation. Use the same flat prior as before.

p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=1000 )
prior <- rep( 1, length( p_grid ) )
likelihood <- dbinom( x=8 , size=15 , prob=p_grid )
posterior <- prior * likelihood
posterior <- posterior / sum( posterior )
plot( p_grid , posterior , type ='l' )

# 3M2. Draw 10,000 samples from the grid approximation from above. Then use the samples to calculate the 90% HPDI for p.
samples <- sample( p_grid , prob=posterior , size=1e4 , replace=T )
dens( samples )
HPDI( samples , prob=.90 )

# 3M3. Construct a posterior predictive check for this model and data. This means simulate the distribution of samples, averaging over the posterior uncertainty in p. What is the probability of observing 8 water in 15 tosses?
ppc <- rbinom( n=length(samples) , size=15 , prob=samples )  
simplehist( ppc )

# 3M4. Using the posterior distribution constructed from the new (8/15) data, now calculate the probability of observing 6 water in 9 tosses.
# I guess this means using the posterior now as a prior
prior2 <- posterior

plot( p_grid , posterior2 , type='l' )

# 3M5. Start over at 3M1, but now use a prior that is zero below p = 0.5 and a constant above p = 0.5. This corresponds to prior information that a majority of the Earthâ€™s surface is water. Repeat each problem above and compare the inferences. What difference does the better prior make? If it helps, compare inferences (using both priors) to the true value p = 0.7.

# all boys born as first-born
sum( birth1 )
# all boys born as second born
sum( birth2 )

# 3H1. Using grid approximation, compute the posterior distribution for the probability of a birth being a boy. Assume a uniform prior probability. 

p_vec <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=1000 ) # parameter p and its conjectures
prior <- rep( 1 , length( p_vec ) ) # boy , girl, [counts of these 2 conjectures to happen, without data]
## turn data into observation
all_births <- c( birth1 , birth2 )
nboys <- sum( all_births ) # 111
size <- length( all_births ) # 200
##
likelihood <- dbinom( x=nboys , size=size , prob=p_vec )
# update prior
posterior <- prior * likelihood
posterior <- posterior / sum( posterior )
plot( p_vec , posterior , type='l' )

# Which parameter value maximizes the posterior probability?
p_vec[ which.max(posterior) ] # 0.554

# 3H2. Using the sample function, draw 10,000 random parameter values from the posterior distribution you calculated above. Use these samples to estimate the 50%, 89%, and 97% highest posterior density intervals.
samples <- sample( p_vec , prob=posterior , size=1e4 , replace=T )
samples %>% HPDI(0.5)
samples %>% HPDI(0.89)
samples %>% HPDI(0.97)

# 3H3. Use rbinom to simulate 10,000 replicates of 200 births. You should end up with 10,000 numbers, each one a count of boys out of 200 births. Compare the distribution of predicted numbers of boys to the actual count in the data (111 boys out of 200 births). There are many good ways to visualize the simulations, but the dens command (part of the rethinking package) is probably the easiest way in this case. Does it look like the model fits the data well? That is, does the distribution of predictions include the actual observation as a central, likely outcome?

fp_sims <- rbinom( n=1e4 , size=200 , prob=samples )
fp_sims %>% length()
dens( fp_sims ); abline( v=111 ) # it looks like a good fit indeed

# 3H4. Now compare 10,000 counts of boys from 100 simulated first borns only to the number of boys in the first births, birth1. How does the model look in this light?

# now different data
size <- length( birth1 )
nboys <- sum( birth1 )
likelihood <- dbinom( x=nboys , size=size , prob=p_vec )
posterior <- prior * likelihood
posterior <- posterior / sum( posterior )
plot( p_vec , posterior , type='l' )

# posterior samples
samples <- sample( p_vec , prob=posterior , size=1e4 , replace=T )
fp_sims <- rbinom( n=1e4 , size=100 , samples )
dens( fp_sims ); abline( v=51 , col='red' )
simplehist( fp_sims ); abline( v=51 , col='red')

# 3H5. The model assumes that sex of first and second births are independent. To check this assumption, focus now on second births that followed female first borns. Compare 10,000 simulated counts of boys to only those second births that followed girls. To do this correctly, you need to count the number of first borns who were girls and simulate that many births, 10,000 times. Compare the counts of boys in your simulations to the actual observed count of boys following girls. How does the model look in this light? Any guesses what is going on in these data?

b2_aftergirl <- birth2[birth1 == 0]
size <- length( b2_aftergirl ) # 49
nboys <- sum( b2_aftergirl ) # 39
likelihood <- dbinom( x=nboys , size=size , prob=p_vec )
posterior <- prior * likelihood
posterior <- posterior / sum( posterior )
plot( p_vec , posterior , type='l' )

# posterior sample and future prodiction simulation
samples <- sample( p_vec , prob=posterior , size=1e4 , replace=T )
fp_sims <- rbinom( n=1e4 , size=size , prob=samples )
dens( fp_sims/size , adj=0.9); abline( v=39/size ,col='red') # it still looks good

# What is going on in the data?
# The data seems to support a model, where after having a girl it is much more likely having a girl. This could be because families, after having one child of each sex stopped having babies, and there are therefore concentrated in the 2-child group of families.
